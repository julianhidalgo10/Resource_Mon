## Project Overview

**`resource_mon`** is a real-time system resource monitoring tool developed in the C programming language for GNU/Linux operating systems. Executed from the command-line interface (CLI), it provides clear and continuous visualization of key CPU and memory information.

### Main Features

- Detailed CPU information:
  - Name and manufacturer
  - Number of physical cores and total threads
  - Real-time usage percentage for each thread
- Memory information:
  - Total physical memory (MB)
  - Total swap memory (MB)
  - Usage percentage of physical and swap memory
- Data updates every second
- Persistent on-screen interface (no scroll)
- Program terminates with `q` key, `Ctrl + C`, or terminal closure

## Technical Requirements
- GNU/Linux operating system
- gcc compiler
- make build tool

### Source files and their roles
- cpuinfo_manip.*: Retrieves CPU information from /proc/cpuinfo and per-thread usage from /proc/stat.
- meminfo_manip.*: Reads memory usage from /proc/meminfo.
- tui.*: Text-based User Interface for displaying data on screen.
- resource_mon.c: Main execution loop of the program, integrates all above functionalities.

## Tests
Test files validate the correct functionality of each individual module:
- cpuinfo_test: Tests the functions that retrieve and calculate CPU usage.
- meminfo_test: Verifies parsing of memory information.
- tui_test: Tests functions related to screen display.
- Test files are located in the test/ folder.

## Makefile Usage

### Main commands from the project root

```
make              # Builds resource_mon and tests (equivalent to make all)
make resource_mon # Compiles only the main program
make tests        # Compiles only the test executables
make clean        # Removes object files and executables
```

### Commands from subdirectories
From src/:

```
- make: Compiles source files into .o files
- make clean: Removes the .o files
```

## How to Run the Program
./bin/resource_mon

```
- The screen updates every second.
- Press the q key to exit the program.
